title: Setup wholesale on existing WooCommerce site
f_objetivo: >-
  Walnut Creek Foods Texas currently runs two websites: a WooCommerce site for
  retail customers and a company website where one can find information and
  inquire about becoming a wholesale customer. Registered wholesale customers
  can make orders through special forms made using Gravity Forms. This solution
  is unwieldy both for the customers and WalCFT: on the customers side the forms
  aren't much of a shopping experience and then WalCFT staff wastes time
  manually getting the submissions into QuickBooks, their enterprise resource
  management solution. WalCFT handles everything, from finances to order
  fulfilling, from this ERP. Our goal is to upgrade WalCFT's existing
  WooCommerce site so that wholesale customers can make their orders there, same
  as retail customers. Wholesale users should see only the products specifically
  enabled for them, and at the price set for that product and that particular
  account. Finally, all orders must be synced with QuickBooks at all times.

The WooCommerce site is currently not being hosted by us. In order to carry out the configuration and development required on the website, we need to first host it ourselves so that we are in full control of all of its pieces. In this way we get in charge of the site and can guarantee it stays in working order throughout development and beyond.

Included with our price is a year of hosting and maintenance of the site (~2h monthly work).

Not included is the cost of Wholesale Suite which is required. See pricing here: https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com/bundle/
